## Overview

This solution is an opportunity to review the basics from Javascript Vanilla. I am going to do it in HTML5, CSS3 and JS without frameworks.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
- See how I did the challenge
